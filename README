Google Charts template tag
==========================

This is a suite of template tags to assist in generating charts using Google's
`Chart API`__. There's deliberately no Python-level API; try pygooglechart__
for that.

Currently the library is long on code, and short on testing and documentation.
It's only been tested against Django trunk (r7135) and Python 2.5.

For example usage, see ``docs/examples.html``.
